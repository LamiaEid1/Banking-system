Banking System Project (Java)

This Banking System project, built using Java and developed in Visual Studio Code, simulates a real-world banking environment, allowing users to perform basic banking operations. The system is designed to manage accounts, process deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and balance checks.

Key features of the system include:

Account Creation: Users can create new accounts by providing necessary details such as name, address, and initial deposit amount.
Deposit & Withdrawal: Account holders can deposit and withdraw funds while ensuring the balance doesnâ€™t fall below zero.
Fund Transfer: Users can transfer money between accounts within the system.
Balance Inquiry: The system allows users to check their current balance in real-time.
Authentication: Secure login system using usernames and passwords to prevent unauthorized access.
The project showcases object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It also highlights the use of basic file handling to store and retrieve account information, ensuring data persistence.

Developed with simplicity in mind, the system provides a user-friendly interface and is fully customizable for additional features such as transaction history or loan management.
